# StarConApp_Public
## Intro
We all know the overwhelming size of this absolute gargantuan space sim that is Starfield. This mod simply allows you to keep track for your progress when exploring thousands of planets. It has a detailed data on all planets, moons and asteroid.

## DETAILS
You can select the planet, moon or asteroid and get the details. I scraped as much as I can from what I could find online (shout out to reddit user substantial-dig-9976 who compiled the json format for the resources file and put it on pastebin) and to all the Starborn who made this possible, thanks.

## What can you do in this app?

Check the properties of the celestial object (Type, Gravity, Temperature, Life and Resources) with Icons that you can modify and change if you want.
It keeps track of your logs and gives you a progress bar with percentage and ranking system.
Allows you to upload your own screenshots when you visit planets. (Supports PNG only for the time being)
Allows you to save logs per celestial body (Main reason for this apps existence really)


## INSTALLATION

Extract it to any location you fancy (I wouldn't recommend program files folder)
And open StarConApp.exe
Done
!!Note that your progress and rank are all saved in the location you extracted it in so it is portable but don't delete files in the cap, celestials, data, img, logs and rank folder. It can break the app. Just saying.


## UPDATES
More updates are yet to come to this app and when CK is released, I hope to make this work in-game like a pip-boy from fallout.
I am also working on the android app for it and will release that as well.


To all the explorers out there,
Good luck!
